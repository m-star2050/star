## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Technologies
- **Blade Templates:** Server-side rendering
- **Alpine.js:** Reactive UI & Kanban state management
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first styling
- **HTML5 Drag & Drop API:** Native browser drag-drop
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** AJAX stage updates

### Backend Technologies
- **Laravel 11:** Framework
- **PHP 8.2+:** Language
- **Eloquent ORM:** Database abstraction
- **Query Builder:** Complex filtering

### Kanban Board Architecture

**Alpine.js Component:**
```javascript
function kanbanBoard() {
    return {
        open: true,
        showCreate: false,
        draggedDeal: null,
        deals: {
            prospect: [],
            negotiation: [],
            proposal: [],
            closed_won: [],
            closed_lost: [],
        },
        handleDragStart() { /* ... */ },
        handleDrop() { /* ... */ },
        updateDealStage() { /* AJAX call */ }
    }
}
```

**Drag & Drop Flow:**
1. User drags deal card
2. `dragstart` event captures deal data
3. Visual feedback applied (opacity, borders)
4. User drops in new column
5. `drop` event triggers
6. Frontend updates deal array immediately
7. AJAX request updates database
8. Success/error handling

### CSS Styling

**Kanban Specific:**
```css
.kanban-column { min-height: 500px; }
.deal-card { cursor: move; transition: all 0.2s; }
.deal-card:hover { transform: translateY(-2px); }
.dragging { opacity: 0.5; }
.drag-over { border-color: #3b82f6; background: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.05); }
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE crm_pipelines (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
